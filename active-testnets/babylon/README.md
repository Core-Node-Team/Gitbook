### Babylon is a PoS (proof-of-stake) blockchain that provides secure Bitcoin timestamps to its transactions. Babylon is built using the Tendermint consensus engine and Cosmos SDK. It leverages cutting-edge cryptographic technologies and advanced Cosmos SDK features to send succinct, verifiable, and adversary-slashing checkpoints of the Babylon chain to BTC as BTC transactions. The BTC timestamps of Babylon checkpoints provide BTC-level security to all Babylon transactions.
